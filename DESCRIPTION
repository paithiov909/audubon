Description: A collection of Japanese text processing tools for filling
    Japanese iteration marks, hiraganization, katakanization,
    romanization, segmentation by phrase, and text normalization which is
    based on rules for the 'Sudachi' morphological analyzer and the
    'NEologd' (Neologism dictionary for 'MeCab').  These features are
    specific to Japanese and are not implemented in 'ICU' (International
    Components for Unicode).
